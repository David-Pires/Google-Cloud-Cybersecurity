Cloud computing and
security controls will differ for an organization. Since Cloud computing
is different from an on premises deployment, Cloud security controls
will also differ. In this video, we'll review
Cloud security controls and how to determine which controls should be implemented
to reduce risk. Remember, Cloud
security controls are measures that safeguard Cloud environments
from threats by reducing the likelihood and
impact of harmful attacks. There are three types of
cybersecurity controls, technical, administrative,
and physical. Technical controls
include hardware and software used
to protect assets. Administrative controls
include policies, procedures and guidelines put into place to protect assets? Physical controls include
any concrete means of preventing or detecting unauthorized access
to facilities, systems, or assets like gates and locks or key
cards to enter a building? As a Cloud security
professional, when you properly implement
security controls, you help safeguard Cloud environments from
vulnerabilities, minimize the effects
of harmful attacks, meet and maintain your
organization's compliance goals. Security controls are
a central element of any Cloud computing strategy, so how do you decide which
controls to use and when? As you may recall,
threat modeling is the process of
identifying assets, their vulnerabilities,
and how each is exposed to threats.
Here's a pro tip. Conduct a threat
model to identify the right controls
for the threats your organization faces. This will help the
Cloud security team save time and money. If a threat is related to a low probability or
a low impact risk, then the organization
can accept the risk, or it can be transferred instead of mitigated
by a control. An organization can
transfer risk by buying a cyber insurance
policy that helps cover this risk or transferring the risk to the user in the
terms of service agreement. For threat modeling, you can use an existing threat
model methodology to identify threats across
common threat categories. Then you can select controls to address the threats
that you've identified. For example, if you
identify an attack risk that threatens proper
authentication in your threat model, you might choose a control like second factor
authentication using a key to help
prevent the attack. After applying controls based on the threat model and
standards and regulations, there may be some remaining
risk or residual risk. Residual risk can be
accepted or reduced. If the team accepts any
residual risk that remains, there is a possibility that the business might fail to meet necessary compliance with the required standard
of regulation. If an organization is unable
to show they are compliant, they risk fines and civil
and criminal penalties. The organization might also be unable to sign contracts with partners or customers that require standards
or regulations. By threat modeling
and checking that you've met compliance
control standards, you can implement the
necessary controls to reduce risk to an
acceptable level.
