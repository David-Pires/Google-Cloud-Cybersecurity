# Security controls table

NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 organizes security and privacy controls into 20 control families. Each control family contains controls that are related to the specific topic of the family. Each control family also uses a unique identifier. For example, the identifier for **Configuration Management** is **CM**—this topic relates to the configuration of systems. The following table lists the 20 control families and their identifiers.
