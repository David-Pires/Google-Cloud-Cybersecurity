**Risk Management Policy Notes** 

| Policy Section | Recommended Change(s) | Reasoning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Access Control | In addition to requiring employees to lock their devices, devices should be configured to automatically lock after two minutes of inactivity and require the user to reenter their credentials when they return. | If an employee leaves a device unlocked while stepping away from their workstation, the information on the device may be vulnerable to unauthorized people. This could result in a data breach, which poses reputational and legal risks to the company. Configuring devices to automatically lock after two minutes decreases these risks. |
| Awareness and Training | New employees should still be trained on cyber threats. Training should be added for current employees on a regular basis and when system changes make training necessary. Training should be specific to each employee's role.  | The cyber threat landscape is constantly changing, so it’s important that employees be trained regularly on cybersecurity best practices to prevent a data breach or other incident. Employees in different roles and departments have access to specific information that could result in different kinds of risk—such as business slowdowns if needed systems stop working—or legal risk if sensitive data is leaked.  |
| Configuration Management | Users can install approved, vetted software on their workstations as necessary. Unvetted and/or unapproved software may not be downloaded on devices. | Allowing users to download unvetted software may lead users to download applications that could introduce malware into the environment. Therefore, it is important for Cymbal Bank to know and control the software installed onto its systems. |
| Identification and Authentication | Employee passwords should be allowed to contain spaces and special characters.  | Including special characters allows employees to create stronger, more complex passwords. This makes it more difficult for bad actors to gain unauthorized access, which could lead to data loss. |
| Physical and Environmental Protection | Individuals must be removed from the server room authorization list if they no longer have a business need to access it. | If an employee switches roles or leaves the company, the individual no longer has a business need to access Cymbal Bank’s server room. Access needs to be tightly controlled to ensure the servers and the data they’re processing aren't vulnerable to unauthorized people.  |
| System and Information Integrity | Security alert and advisory information should be shared throughout the entire organization, not just with the security team.  | It’s important for all employees to receive security alerts and advisory information because all employees need to contribute to keep the organization’s infrastructure secure.  |
