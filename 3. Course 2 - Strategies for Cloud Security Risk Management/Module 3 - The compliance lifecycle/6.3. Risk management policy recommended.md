**Risk Management Policy Notes** 

| Policy Section | Recommended Change(s) | Reasoning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1\. Access Control | (A) Require automatic device lock after a defined period of inactivity (e.g., 15 mins). (B) Prohibit non-privileged accounts from performing privileged functions. | AC-11: Mandates automatic locks to prevent unauthorized access to unattended systems. AC-6 (Least Privilege): Privileged actions must be restricted to authorized accounts only to prevent lateral movement and accidental misconfigurations. |
| 2\. Awareness & Training | Implement role-based security training. While all get "basic" training, specific roles (Devs, HR, Finance) must receive specialized training. | AT-2 (b): Requires "role-based security and privacy training" to address the specific risks associated with different job functions. Identical training for all is insufficient for specialized threats. |
| 3\. Configuration Management | Restrict software installation to authorized personnel only. Implement "Allow-lists" for approved software. | CM-11: Restricting user-installed software prevents the introduction of malware, unlicensed software, and shadow IT into the corporate network. |
| 4\. Identification & Auth. | Remove the prohibition of spaces/punctuation. Adopt modern standards (NIST SP 800-63B) focusing on length over complex rotation. Update the "blacklisted passwords" list in real-time or more frequently than once a month. | IA-5 (1): NIST now favors long passphrases and discourages arbitrary character restrictions (like blocking punctuation) which can actually make passwords easier to crack. Password lists should be updated frequently to account for new breaches. |
| 5\. Incident Response | No major changes needed, but ensure training covers "Privacy" incidents specifically. | IR-2: The current policy is strong on frequency, but NIST emphasizes that content must include "specific roles and responsibilities" and coordination with external entities. |
| 6\. Physical Protection | Allow for the removal of individuals from the server room access list (offboarding). Implement periodic access reviews (e.g., every 90 days). | PE-2 (c): Access lists must be "reviewed and approved" periodically. The inability to remove users is a critical security flaw (insider threat) and violates the principle of revoking access upon role change or termination. |
| 7\. Risk Assessment | Formalize the frequency of vulnerability scans (e.g., weekly or upon significant changes) and integrate automated alerting. | RA-5: While "ongoing" is good, NIST requires a defined "organization-defined frequency" and automated tools to provide a more consistent defensive posture. |
| 8\. System Integrity | Automate the sharing of security alerts and integrate them into a SIEM or centralized dashboard for real-time response. | SI-5: Relying on "regular sharing" is slow. NIST 800-53 suggests automated distribution of security alerts to ensure timely response to emerging threats. |
