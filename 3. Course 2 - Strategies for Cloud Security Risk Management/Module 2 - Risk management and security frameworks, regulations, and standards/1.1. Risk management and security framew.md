# 📑 Risk Management Frameworks: Deep Dive | Mergulho Profundo em Frameworks

Frameworks are essential tools for strengthening an organization's security posture by providing guidelines, best practices, and recommended security controls.
*Frameworks são ferramentas essenciais para fortalecer a postura de segurança de uma organização, fornecendo diretrizes, melhores práticas e controles de segurança recomendados.*

## 🏛️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Components

**🇺🇸 English:**
The NIST CSF acts as a translation layer between multidisciplinary teams. It consists of:

* **The Framework Core:** Five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
* **Profiles:** Used to describe the **Current State** vs. the **Target State**.
* **Implementation Tiers:** Measure the thoroughness of risk management, from **Tier 1 (Partial)** to **Tier 4 (Adaptive)**.

**🇧🇷 Português:**
*O NIST CSF atua como uma camada de tradução entre equipes multidisciplinares. Consiste em:*

* ***Framework Core:** Cinco funções (Identificar, Proteger, Detectar, Responder, Recuperar).*

* ***Perfis (Profiles):** Usados para descrever o **Estado Atual** vs. o **Estado Alvo**.*
* ***Tiers de Implementação:** Medem o rigor da gestão de riscos, do **Tier 1 (Parcial)** ao **Tier 4 (Adaptável)**.*

## ☁️ Cloud-Specific & Prescriptive Frameworks

| Framework | 🎯 Key Focus / Foco Principal |
| --- | --- |
| **CSA CCM** | 197 control objectives across 17 domains. Its spreadsheet maps to multiple industry standards. |
| **Google SRF** | Based on NIST core functions; maps controls specifically to **Google Cloud solutions**. |
| **CIS Controls** | Prescriptive and prioritized best practices used to defend against cyber threats. |

## 🛡️ Security Insights | Insights de Segurança

* **Mapping Efficiency:** The **CSA CCM** is a "force multiplier." By fulfilling a single CCM control, you may simultaneously satisfy requirements for ISO, NIST, and PCI DSS.
* **The Gap Analysis Power:** Comparing **Current vs. Target Profiles** is the most effective way to justify a security budget by visually showing the gaps that need investment.
* **Prescriptive Defense:** While NIST and ISO tell you *what* to achieve, **CIS Controls** are highly prescriptive, telling you exactly *how* to configure your environment to stop common attacks.
* **Resilience Focus:** The **Google SRF** is specialized for cloud environments, ensuring that even if an attack succeeds, the workload has the resilience to recover quickly.
