>> Cloud security analysts have a lot
of important responsibilities and usually work with a variety of people
inside and outside of their organizations. To be successful in their role, there
are many skills they'll need to develop. Learning these skills is like
adding tools to a tool belt. The more tools you have, the more situations you'll be
prepared to handle with ease. In this video, we'll explore cloud
security analysts role within the security ecosystem and
within their specific organization. We'll also cover the skills you'll use
to succeed in your responsibilities as a cloud security analyst. Let's review some of cloud security
analysts responsibilities within the security ecosystem. As a cloud security analyst,
communicating cloud security concepts to a non technical audience
is a core responsibility. For example, you might help to train other departments
in using the companys it assets securely. As a cloud security analyst, you may
also work with compliance teams to help develop cloud security policies for
your organization. To do this, you'll need to understand and
communicate industry security compliance standards to help make sure the
organization aligns with all the laws and regulations that apply. By keeping your organization's cloud
assets safe and in compliance, you'll help keep the cloud safer for
everyone. Next, let's discuss some of the core
skills you'll need in your role. Developing problem solving and analytical
thinking skills will be important to your work as a cloud security analyst. Issues can come up suddenly, so you and your team will need
to work quickly to resolve them. Even if you're working on a new type of
issue, being able to break it down into smaller parts makes it easier
to understand the problem. This will help you identify
the best solution. Being able to do this in different
situations is a valuable skill that will serve you
throughout your career. Attention to detail is an important skill
for a cloud security analyst to have. The difference between normal and abnormal
activity in cloud resources can be subtle. Cloud security analysts who pick up on
details can catch and solve problems before they grow into serious issues, and
that's a huge help to any organization. As a cloud security analyst, you'll be an
important part of the cloud security team. You'll also work with other
departments as needed. Because you'll be working with others, collaboration is an important skill you'll
need to be successful in your role. Next, let's explore some of the technical
skills cloud security analysts use on the job. As a cloud security analyst, you'll learn
to define and configure security controls. Security controls are controls that
safeguard cloud environments from threats and minimize the effects
of harmful attacks. Security controls include
antivirus software and firewalls. Another major part of a cloud security
analyst's role is to conduct network analysis. Analysts configure and use security
tools to closely monitor and log network activity in the cloud, then receive alerts
when something appears out of place. Security analysts also use their
skills to monitor and manage intrusion detection systems, or IDS, and
intrusion protection systems, or IPS. Intrusion detection systems
monitor your cloud system for threat actors trying to gain access,
while intrusion protection systems proactively remove threats
based on specific rules. Depending on the industry, an organization's cloud system
may be audited for compliance or security by internal auditing teams or
external regulatory bodies. Cloud security analysts prepare for audits
by understanding the audit requirements, identifying weaknesses, and
implementing necessary solutions. After an audit, they collaborate with
audit teams to plan for improvement. As a cloud security analyst, there will be
many opportunities to learn new skills and develop those you already have. And as you develop these skills, you'll be better prepared to handle the
responsibilities that come with your role. There's no better feeling than knowing
exactly what to do when a complex security problem arises.
